## Project Title
Ticket-taka

---

## Problem Statement
Sports fans often lack a centralized platform where they can easily browse upcoming events, compare them, and purchase tickets.
Existing platforms are often cluttered, limited to specific sports or regions, and do not provide enough detailed information about the events themselves.

---

## Target Users
The platform is intended for sports fans of all ages who are interested in attending live events such as football matches, basketball games, and more.
It especially targets users who actively follow sports but struggle to find a simple and reliable way to discover events, get detailed information, and purchase tickets in one place.
Additionally, it benefits tourists and casual attendees looking for local sporting events during their stay.

---

## Proposed Solution
The web application provides a centralized and user-friendly platform where users can browse a wide range of upcoming sports events, view detailed information such as date, location, participating teams or athletes, and purchase tickets directly.
The platform will include filtering options by sport, location, and date, along with interactive maps, event descriptions, and user reviews to help users make informed decisions quickly and easily.

## How You Came Up With the Idea
The idea came from a personal experience of trying to find and attend a local football match while travelling, only to realize how difficult it was to get clear event information and tickets from one place.
After discussing this with other sports fans, it became clear that many people face the same problem, which inspired the creation of a platform that simplifies the entire process.
